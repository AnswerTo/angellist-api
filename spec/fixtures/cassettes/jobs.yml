        their critical data. Right now, the most important data businesses have is
        stuck in databases, which are essentially black boxes. As a result, organizations
        don''t have the data they need to understand their business and make good
        decisions. \r\n\r\nWe''re disrupting the massive Enterprise Analytics market.
        We recently raised our Series A from Avalon Ventures and are about to open
        our product up to the public. We have a very large waiting list and our current
        customers truly love the product. \r\n\r\nWe''re still a small team, and we''re
        looking for our first design hire to be the creative voice in our company
        and lead product design. As lead designer, you would be working at the exciting
        edge of data visualization and interface design. \r\n\r\nWhat we''re looking
        for:\r\nExperience in product design\r\nStrong background in UI design\r\nDeep
        understanding of UX principles\r\nFluency with HTML and CSS\r\nJavascript
        knowledge a plus (but not necessary) \r\n\r\nOur benefits: \r\nMassages\r\nA
        beautiful office\r\nVery flexible vacation/time-off\r\nPlus all the standard
        benefits (health, dental, etc.)\r\n\r\nSalary and equity would depend on experience.
        As a general guideline, you are joining us at a very early stage, so both
        salary and equity would reflect the fact that you are part of the core initial
        team. \r\n\r\nIf interested, please send over a resume and a link to a portfolio
